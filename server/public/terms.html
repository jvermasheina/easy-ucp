        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Easy UCP offers lifetime access pricing during our launch period:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Joining the founders list reserves your spot and locks in lifetime pricing. Payment is due when we launch (approximately 2 weeks). Founders list membership does not create a binding obligation to purchase until you complete payment at launch.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.3 Payment Processing</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">

        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.4 Taxes</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Prices do not include applicable taxes, VAT, or similar charges, which will be added to your invoice as required by law.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.5 Price Changes</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          After launch, lifetime pricing will no longer be available. We reserve the right to introduce monthly subscription pricing or modify pricing for new customers. Existing lifetime access customers will not be affected by future price changes.
