        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.1 Lifetime Pricing</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Easy UCP offers lifetime access pricing during our launch period:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2">Micro (< 100 products): $199 one-time</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Small (100-1,000 products): $399 one-time</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Medium (1,000-10,000 products): $599 one-time</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Large (10,000+ products): $999 one-time</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.2 Founders List</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Joining the founders list reserves your spot and locks in lifetime pricing. Payment is due when we launch (approximately 2 weeks). Founders list membership does not create a binding obligation to purchase until you complete payment at launch.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.3 Payment Processing</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          All payments are processed securely through Stripe. By providing payment information, you authorize us to charge the specified amount. All fees are in USD unless otherwise stated.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.4 Taxes</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Prices do not include applicable taxes, VAT, or similar charges, which will be added to your invoice as required by law.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.5 Price Changes</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          After launch, lifetime pricing will no longer be available. We reserve the right to introduce monthly subscription pricing or modify pricing for new customers. Existing lifetime access customers will not be affected by future price changes.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5.6 Lifetime Access Limitations and Modifications</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-semibold">
          IMPORTANT: Easy UCP is an early-stage startup. Lifetime access is subject to the following conditions:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Service Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to modify, pivot, or fundamentally change the service offering. If changes materially affect core functionality, we will provide 60 days' notice and offer a pro-rated refund based on reasonable service valuation.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Service Discontinuation:</strong> As a startup, we may need to shut down or discontinue the service (see Section 10.4). Lifetime access does not guarantee perpetual service availability.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Feature Changes:</strong> Specific features may be added, removed, or modified. Lifetime access guarantees access to the core UCP integration service but not to any specific feature set.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Protocol Changes:</strong> Universal Commerce Protocol is an evolving standard. We will maintain compatibility as the protocol evolves, but significant protocol changes may require service modifications.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Performance Expectations:</strong> Lifetime access does not include guarantees of specific uptime SLAs, support response times, or performance metrics beyond reasonable best efforts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          By purchasing lifetime access, you acknowledge that you are supporting an early-stage startup and accept the inherent risks of service changes, pivots, or discontinuation. Your lifetime access payment is an investment in the current service vision with the understanding that startups must remain flexible to survive and adapt.
